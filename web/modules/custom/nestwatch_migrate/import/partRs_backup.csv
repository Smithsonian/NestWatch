SALOSHEMD1,,2014-07-11,2441-96385,P,alive,I just wanted to let Mandy know that I saw this bird of undetermined sex which she had banded on 7/1. It was carrying  nesting material around the yard and singing with its beak full. I later discovered a carolina wren nest -- probably one of their famous dummy nests -- in my herb box right outside the kitchen door. A beautifully built nest that I will definitely show the grandchildren when they come later this week.,0

LAFOMELVA1,,2017-09-30,2561-56831,P,alive,"""If this sighting is correct, this bird would be from 2012.  It was a female and I am certain it had a yellow white combo.  There are many large, older trees being cut down and it is possible that birds are shifting.  My feeders run all year round.   So she could have come in.  The pond is working and there is a bird bath.  There is abundant cover and seed.  I was startled while gardening, and she was moving fast.   Will be on the look out for her again.   I had a """"drop-in"""" bird come to the garden. It was smaller than others, yellow head and chest, shorter tail, some kind of warbler.  I could not hear a song, but later in the day I saw it and heard a song.  Am checking Audubon recordings and cannot recognize it.  It was not a Prothonoatary Warbler as this bird had a definite chain of notes in a song.  I get """"drop-ins"""" now.  Will be on the lookout.""",0
LAFOMELVA1,,2017-12-06,2651-56295,P,alive,"The Cardinal was feeding at the window feeder with safflower. Red-headed finches, Chickadees, House Sparrows, Carolina Wrens have been seen. The garden is asleep. Fox sighted at pond at 11 p.m. The neighbor's dog was barking furiously with a frightful tone. I had hoped to see St. Nicholas (the Czech Santo who is skinny),who comes the night of December 5, but was more surprised. Rats and squirrels sighted. The Juncos have come. An immature Red-tailed hawk was sighted at Tuckahoe Park while I was doing an Ivy pull, hence a brief silence in the p.m. one day last week. There are some sparrows that are different coming to yard. Can't identify the little brown guys. Will do the Christmas bird count for Arlington - 6 parks. Red-headed Finches are here. A phlox bloomed last week. A Heath Aster bloomed a small flower. Salvia still in bloom - 1 spike. Milkweed in seed. Monarda in seed. Coreopsis and Coneflower in seed. Rabbits got some Asters. Planted four types of native shade plants and they are doing well. I've kept a big wood pile in the back for cover for birds and also let the bush by my window get bushy for cover. Saw a lot of Sparrows in the bush all puffed up. Providing Black oil Sunflower seeds, Safflower seeds, suet, and hulled peanuts. See city pigeons, American Crows, and White -breasted Nuthatch. Hairy and Downy woodpeckers and a small flitty bird - Red-crested Kinglet? Don't know. Goldfinches come to suet. Lots of Earthworms in the soil. No more spiders. Mice have come into the house so had to set traps. Mulching and putting beds to sleep. I put up a bat house. So that is the picture for December.",0
LAFOMELVA1,,2017-12-14,2651-56295,P,found dead,"Other birds sighted at feeders: Norther Cardinals, Chickadees (unbanded), Mourning Doves, Starlings, Crows, BlueJays, Red-headed Finches, English Sparrows, a Sparrow with a Striped head, and a Carolina Wren with an Alum, Orange, and White band combo. The garden is sleeping now. Things are in seed, mulch is going in, beds are turned, and seed heads of flowering plants have been dead headed and put into the bed with a covering of mulch. Weeding is a big job. The feeders are kept full with safflower, Black OIl Sunflower, suet, bark butter balls with cayenne pepper, and hulled peanuts. There are four squirrels who come down to raid the feeders. Four large branches fell from the big Silver Maple and I fear we will need to take it down in the next 5 years. It is more than 60 years old. I have Oak, Chinquapin, and Maple growing. The Strawberry Bush provided flowers and food. The Beauty Berry bushes have berries. The pond is running and has minnows in it . Wlliamsburg Middle School Pond will be saved. A teacher is using my pond plan . Now is the time when I walk around the neighborhood and take pictures of birds nests and record the location - just for personal curiousity,",0

LAFOMELVA1,,2017-03-15,2651-56296,P,alive,"Cloudy and cold, 21degrees F.  Wind - 15-30 mph with gusts. Snow and ice. Feeders are full with safflower, bird bark nuggets ( peanut butter and lard), mixed seed with sunflower seed, thistle, blocks of suet.  Finches, Nuthatches, Chickadees, Cardinals, Starlings, and a female Baltimore Oriole - took a photo.  I have also put out corn for the squirrels to eat at the back of the yard.  The pond and small waterfall are working.  A side feeder has been loaded and it is frequented by Red headed finches, a Carolina Wren, a Nuthatch, English Sparrows and the female Baltimore Oriole, a red-bellied wood pecker.   Squirrels come to feed upside down and there is benign neglect in turning them away in such cold. It is important to show kindness and generosity in such a blast of cold.",0

She and her mate abandoned their excavation work in a tree stump in the back yard and relocated to a nest box. This occurred about April 18. They continue to be using the nest box. I saw them yesterday (April 24) going in and out of it. I can't tell what stage of nesting they are at. If they got straight to work and she laid eggs let's say around 4/20, I should be seeing some action by the weekend (action being lots of feeding). I hope everything survives: the box is on the side of the garage right near the house where there is a lot of human activity. Might not have been the best place to locate it. I'll keep you posted.",0

He keeps flying back to the shrub and yelling at the invader.  The chipmunk comes and darts at the sparrow and then retreats into the shrub.  The sparrow has yet to do more than land on the outside of the shrub, he isn't going into the shrub yet.",0

Blueberries were eaten when still green. Fish in pond.  Am watering the yard.  So dry.  Plan to make a native garden of the front yard.

The day before the feeders were still - White-breasted Nuthatch, unbanded Chickadees, Finches, English Sparrows.  Broad-winged Hawk spotted over Little Falls Road, so this could be the reason for the stillness in the backyard.  A large woodland edge spider still has its web up, Chipmunks and Squirrels active. Fox spotted on the street at 11 p.m. on 10/23/17.  Delphinium still in bloom.  Do not see Honey Bees, nor Bumblebees. Leaves are falling.  Putting seeds into the beds and putting beds to sleep.  Many earthworms in many parts of the yard.  Cardinal Flower still has small blooms.  Taking the Hummingbird feeder down today.  Happy Halloween.",0

BEEGERLNC1,,2017-12-10,1352-92507,P,alive,"BANDED AMRO: metal band on left leg. Most likely, this is ""my"" AMRO from the ""Neighborhood Resight"" project. The banded robin was last seen in August, when it had just the left metal band (the orange and blue bands had already fallen off the right leg). I could not quite read the band, so there is an outside chance that it is migratory robin with a band on its left leg and is NOT the bird for this project. There is a flock of migratory robins that visit the yard. This AMRO keeps to itself, and it is a female, so most likely it is the bird with band 1352-92507. I will try to read the band with a scope at some point, but seeing the bird again will be difficult.",0

About 8 English Sparrows, 2 Mourning doves, 1 White-breasted Nuthatch, a female unbanded Cardinal and a male unbanded Cardinal, 2 American Crows, about 4 Red-headed Finches, and some smaller Sparrows came to the feeder and fed intensely.

LAFOMELVA1,,2018-02-22,2711-77143,P,alive,"I have seen this bird throughout winter and on the coldest, windiest days. It goes to the feeder for suet. It flits under the porch, in the branch piles, up onto the feeders, quickly feeds, and then parts. It is 3/1/18. Spotted the first daffodil, Forthythia about to bloom, Snowdrops in bloom and small this year. Tulips are coming up. No Bluebells yet. Native Cherry Trees show some signs of budding. Yochino Cherry trees are in the early stage of blooming.They are predicted to bloom unfashionably early this year. A Yoshino tree down the street has bloomed. Have loaded feeders to watch for guests. Peanuts, Safflower, black oil sunflower seed, blocks of suet. I use Wild Birds Unlimited. Other brands are sour and the birds don't eat it. Have heard and seen a Song Sparrow this morning. Could not see the bands. Nesting activity in the box on the tree - Red-headed Finches. Have seen Mourning Doves, Cardinals - males vying for the feeders. Robins have arrived. Holly Berry trees have fruit. Squirrels are active. Mice in the shed attempted to get into the galvanized bin, but were caught. Have smelled Fox musk. Nuthatch comes to the peanuts. Starlings coming to suet. Will put out thistle for Gold Finches. Saw three flocks of Canada geese fly over the yard, direction - north. Have a tree crown cover map of Arlington. I can see my backyard. We are at 41% tree crown cover, down a few per cent. North Arlington is the darkest green. Losing trees to buiding big houses and no big trees. A flock of Sparrows is outside the window. It is cool - 53% and drizzling. Soil is loose and wet. Worms are two inches down. Ready to start planting but must wait for the Days of the Three Witches in May. Then can plant a garden. Must be patient. Birds are so heart warming. Neighbors watch too.",0

LAFOMELVA1,,2018-03-05,2651-56295,P,alive,"Two tall feeders with 3-4 arms are laden with blocks of suet, suet balls, sunflower seeds, bark butter balls, and safflower seed. Feeders are different sizes and one has a plate to perch on. One feeder has a cage for the little guys to go in an get food. A window feeder outside the dining room window lets me see birds come for safflower seed. It was from this feeder last year that I saw a female Baltimore Oriole. But I did not see one yet. Many English Sparrows, Red-headed Finches, Starlings. 3 crows appeared. Squirrels munch on corn cobs to the back of the garden. The pond has water and I am putting water in an elevated bird bath basin. Have heard the Carolina Wren singing but it did not appear at the feeders during the window of the count or when I was counting. Also, around the block there is a Song Sparrow that likes to sing at the top of a particular tree in the native plant garden of a house. I will try to spot if it has bands. There are two unbanded male cardinals that look as if they are young coming to the feeders. They sometimes face off. Red feathers vibrant. In general, birds coming to feeders look fat, sleek, and healthy and show no eye problems. Daffodils blooming, Forsythia beginning to bloom, Teacup Magnolia just about to bloom, all trees show buds, Snowdrops fading, Saw one rabbit at night. Am noting small cup-like nests in small trees- must be last year's nests. The civic association is putting in green strips and planting small trees. NPR had a great show on Migratory Birds on 1A and it was good. Much talk about lighting, wind farms, and keeping cats in doors. All is ready for spring and I will bake a lamb cake for the family. We cannot wait. Let's hope our birds return.",0

Since written the band names are left, left, right, right I thought for sure this was how it was set up. Again if I had just read carefully, I would have been fine. I will adjust. Also no â€œsubmit another sightingâ€ on page after you submit. Just trying to make helpful suggestions. ;)",0

LAFOMELVA1,,2015-09-01,2531-74543,P,alive,"OK.  I really looked at this Catbird.  He was different from the one yesterday.  He ate no-melt suet with pepper in it.  He drank from the shallow pan that is on a pole and to the back of the yard.  This pan is shallow, about 5 ft. 3 in. off the ground, has two rocks in it and is flushed with fresh water everyday.  His eyes look clear.  He looks fat and he is alert.
The usual birds are coming to the feeders:  Mourning Doves, Bluejays, Red-headed Finches, two pairs of Goldfinches, a White-breasted Nuthatch.  But where are the House Wrens and the other banded birds? I often wonder where the birds go to get food, if they do not come to these two feeders.  The feeders are run fairly consistently throughout the year.  The food is peanuts, suet, bark butter, and safflower seeds.  Occasionally, I add a cone of nuts.  Thistle seed for Goldfinches in a sack.  Black-eyed Susan is fading.  Cardinal Flower is fading.  The Goldfinches love to land on the 14 ft. tall Sunflowers and swing back and forth.  The small birds frequently hang out in the taller of three Persimmon trees, then fly to the feeder.  Also, Chickadees hang out in the mature pine tree nearest the feeder, then come to the feeder that is closest to that bough and return to the pine tree.  I have  observed Hummingbirds totally bypass the sugar water feeder, alight and sip at Monarda, then fly straight up to the canopy of the mature elm that is 60 years old.",0

LAFOMELVA1,,2016-03-06,2730-26426,P,alive,"Few if any birds alighting on backyard feeders, though full of safflower seed, peanuts, and thistle.  The one Chickadee came only briefly and flew.  One Goldfinch fed and then left.  It is as if there is a stony pall over the yard.  Then I saw a fox at 5:30 p.m. walking on our street.  I followed it and watched as it attacked and got a squirrel.  I took a photo of the fox.  It has black tips on its ears.  Neighbors say they have seen two others.  But the black-tipped ears is the mark of this one.  It is sleek and fat.  It may be the fox I saw attack a group of 4 squirrels and successfully take one out and proceed to eat it behind a bush in my front yard at 9 a.m. I was seated in the front seat of my car about to go to work.  I just sat still in the car and then, it looked at me and we locked eyes.  Its eyes were golden yellow and dark around the edges.",0

BLUEHPKGA1,,2017-02-21,2750-41419,P,alive,"I have been noticing a CACH coming to the suet feeder and feeding in an interesting way (pecking while hovering rather than perching). I have been noticing this for at least a few weeks. Today was the first time I noticed the bird was banded. Though hard to say for sure, it appears as if the birds right leg is injured. It is possible that the yellow band has begun to slip over the foot. I attempted today to capture the bird (I am a master bander) to see if it needs to be removed. I was unable to catch it today but will try later this week. I assumed the bird was yours only because that is the only active banding I know of at this location of this species. Please contact me if you want to discuss this further. If I am able to catch the bird I will email my findings to Bob Reitsma. My email is adam@atlantaaudubon.org. More info on the bird would be apprecaited",0
